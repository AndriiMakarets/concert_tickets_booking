1) Booking Confirmation:
Ticketing and Payments: After a user books a ticket, the Ticketing service needs to communicate with the Payment service to process the payment. Once the payment is confirmed, the Ticketing service might need to update the booking status.
Event Service Notification: The Event service may need to be notified about the number of tickets sold or remaining for a particular event. This can help in managing the event capacity or triggering additional actions, such as scheduling more sessions if the current ones are fully booked.

2) User Notifications:
If you have a Notification service (or if it's part of another service), updates related to booking confirmations, payment statuses, and event reminders need to be communicated across services. For instance, once a booking is confirmed and paid for, a notification can be sent to the user.

3) Event Updates:
Event and Ticketing Services: Changes in event details (like time, venue, or cancellations) in the Event service need to be propagated to the Ticketing service. This could affect ticket availability, booking options, and might require notifying users of the changes.
Data Synchronization and Aggregation:
Services like Reporting or Analytics might need data from all other services to generate insights or compile reports. For example, data from the Payments, Ticketing, and Events services can be used to analyze sales trends, event popularity, and revenue generation.

4) User Management:
If you have a separate User Management service, this service will often need to interact with other services. For example, user authentication details might be needed by the Ticketing service to verify the user's identity and permissions for bookings.

5) Refunds and Cancellations:
Payments and Ticketing Services: When a ticket is canceled, the Ticketing service needs to notify the Payments service to initiate a refund. This might also involve communication back to the Event service to update the available ticket count.
Cross-Service Health Checks and Performance Monitoring:
Implementing health checks, logging, and tracing across services can help monitor the performance and status of each service. This is essential for maintaining the overall health of the application.
